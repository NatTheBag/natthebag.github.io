# About Me
I'm a student at Stanford Online High School (co2027), with an interest in mechanical and aerospace engineering. My non-professional interests are stenography, coffee making, fountain pens, crochet, and piano.

Professionally, I am skilled in Autodesk Fusion for design and fabrication and Autodesk Inventor for design. In the fabrication department, I mostly do 2 or 3 axis milling and FDM 3D Printing. I have leadership positions on both my schools robotics teams, [FRC](https://pixelators.org/members/hanlu/) and FTC. I also lead the 3D Printing Club at my school. Most importantly, I have a very cute dog called Brownie.
